# Portfolio
.NET Web Project to be published and hosted at Microsoft Azure

This project contains my portfolio and I'll be including all my career positions, personal projects, and games.

EDIT - 07/08/2021
The project has been updated with the continuous deployment between GitHub and Azure. Now every commit automatically publishes the website to Azure.
